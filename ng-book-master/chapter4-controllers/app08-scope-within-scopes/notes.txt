There is one exception in the case that a scope is created inside of a directive, this is called the isolate scope.

With that one exception, all scopes are created with prototypal inheritance, meaning that they have access to their parent scopes. If we are familiar with object-oriented programming, this behavior should look familiar.

It is a best practice to keep our controllers as slim as possible. Itâ€™s bad practice to do any DOM interaction or data manipulating inside the controller.

As we previously mentioned, $scopes have the ability to watch for changes of a particular property and react to the change.
